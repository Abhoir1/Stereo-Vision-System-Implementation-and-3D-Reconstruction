libraries required:

opencv 
numpy
random
matplotlib.pyplot 

Run the code in the terminal.

I have submitted 3 python files for 3 datasets.
The path for the images from all the datasets needs to be changed according to you system.

PART 1
Following outputs will be printed in the terminal
1. Fundamental Matrix
2. Essential Matrix
3. Rotation Matrix
4. Translation Matrix

Following outputs will be showed in the another terminal
1. Detected Features
2. Matched Features

PART 2
Following outputs will be printed in the terminal
1. Homography for left image
2. Homography for left image

Following outputs will be showed in the another terminal
1. Epilines before rectification
2. Epilines after rectification


PART 3
Following outputs will be showed in the another terminal
1. Disparity grayscale
2. Disparity heatmap


PART 4
Following outputs will be showed in the another terminal
1. Depth grayscale
2. Depth heatmap


The disparity calculation takes a lot of time so be patient

The codes and the pdf report is given in the zip file.
